## Lamini SDK

In this SDK, we include tutorials for achieving high-quality results with Language Models (LLMs) like Llama3 using Lamini.</br>  With Lamini, you own the LLM you create -- you can deploy it or release it open source.</br>  This SDK teaches effective tools for building LLMs.</br>  We strongly encourage following the SDK *in order* as the concepts build on each other and are sorted by difficulty.

### Table of Contents

1. [Llama3](01_llama3/README.md) - generate text with Llama3, a powerful LLM.
2. [Eval](02_eval/README.md) - evaluate the quality of your LLM.
3. [Prompt Tuning](03_prompt_tuning/README.md) - improve the quality of your LLM by tuning the prompts you use.
4. [RAG Tuning](04_rag_tuning/README.md) - improve the quality of your LLM by tuning the retrieval component.
5. [Data Pipeline](05_data_pipeline/README.md) - prepare your data for training an LLM.
6. [Fine Tuning](06_fine_tuning/README.md) - fine tune an LLM on your data.

### Notes

The goal of this SDK is to teach and provide examples of important tools for building LLMs.</br>  The examples emphasize simplicitly and readibility, not heavy optimization.</br>  Once you have mastered a module from this SDK, consider forking it and adapting it to your own application.</br>  All of the code in this repository is licensed Apache 2. You are free to use it for any purpose including commercial applications.

### Application

This SDK follows an earnings call application where we use an LLM to answer analyst questions
about earnings calls from public companies.

### Installation Instructions

Before you start, please get your Lamini API key and install the python library.

First, get `<YOUR-LAMINI-API-KEY>` at https://app.lamini.ai/account.
Add the key as an environment variable.
```
export LAMINI_API_KEY="<YOUR-LAMINI-API-KEY>"
```

Next, install the Python library.
```
pip install --upgrade lamini
```

### About Lamini
---
Lamini is the LLM platform for developers to specialize LLMs on their own data and infrastructure: easier, faster, and better than any LLM for their use case.</br> Our mission is to build customizable superintelligence that anyone can build and own.
